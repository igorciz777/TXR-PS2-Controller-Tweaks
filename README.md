## Configuration
You can either use pre-configured patches from the main branch,

or configure your own settings using the [web-based configurator](https://igorciz777.github.io/TXR-PS2-Controller-Tweaks/)
## How to use
Place any of the `.pnach` files to your `<PCSX2 Directory>/cheats/` folder

Activate them in the `Game Properties > Cheats` menu

---
To patch a disc image, use something like the `PS2 Patch Engine` or `PS2 Pnacher`

With the patches that state `(Choose one)`, remember to remove the unwanted ones from the `.pnach` file before patching your game image
